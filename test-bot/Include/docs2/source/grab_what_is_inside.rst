Grab What's Inside
==================

Libraries that Grab uses
------------------------

In short, Grab is a wrapper on top of two powerful libraries: lxml and pycurl.

* The pycurl library allows to configure and perform synchronouse and asynchronous networks equests.
* The lxml library allows to works with DOM tree of HTML document. It allows to select elements with XPATH expressions.

Beside these two libraries Grab uses multiple libraries from the standard python library.
I recommend you to study lxml library for better understaning of how Grab selectors work. Thanks
to lxml developers, they created great documentation: http://lxml.de/
